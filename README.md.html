# BarlowSwin_FL_full

Prototype for Federated Differentiable NAS + 3D Swin-like segmentation model.

Features:
- Simplified Swin3D-like encoder + UNet 3D decoder.
- Differentiable NAS via MixedOp3D and softmax alpha parameters.
- Fed-DARTS-style alternating optimization skeleton (weights w and architecture α).
- Weighted aggregation by client dataset size.
- Learning rate scheduler, gradient clipping, AdamW weight decay.
- Simple int8 quantization helpers for parameter compression.
- Flower-based server and client skeletons.
